abstract="Tree induction is one of the most effective and widely used methods for building classification models. However, many applications require cases to be ranked by the probability of class membership. Probability estimation trees (PETs) have the same attractive features as classification trees (e.g., comprehensibility, accuracy and efficiency in high dimensions and on large data sets). Unfortunately, decision trees have been found to provide poor probability estimates. Several techniques have been proposed to build more accurate PETs, but, to our knowledge, there has not been a systematic experimental analysis of which techniques actually improve the probability-based rankings, and by how much. In this paper we first discuss why the decision-tree representation is not intrinsically inadequate for probability estimation. Inaccurate probabilities are partially the result of decision-tree induction algorithms that focus on maximizing classification accuracy and minimizing tree size (for example via reduced-error pruning). Larger trees can be better for probability estimation, even if the extra size is superfluous for accuracy maximization. We then present the results of a comprehensive set of experiments, testing some straightforward methods for improving probability-based rankings. We show that using a simple, common smoothing method---the Laplace correction---uniformly improves probability-based rankings. In addition, bagging substantially improves the rankings, and is even more effective for this purpose than for improving accuracy. We conclude that PETs, with these simple modifications, should be considered when rankings based on class-membership probability are required.",

abstract="Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis has been successfully applied to classifier problems with two classes. The Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) has been elected as a better way to evaluate classifiers than predictive accuracy or error and has also recently used for evaluating probability estimators. However, the extension of the Area Under the ROC Curve for more than two classes has not been addressed to date, because of the complexity and elusiveness of its precise definition. Some approximations to the real AUC are used without an exact appraisal of their quality. In this paper, we present the real extension to the Area Under the ROC Curve in the form of the Volume Under the ROC Surface (VUS), showing how to compute the polytope that corresponds to the absence of classifiers (given only by the trivial classifiers), to the best classifier and to whatever set of classifiers. We compare the real VUS with ''approximations'' or ''extensions'' of the AUC for more than two classes.",
